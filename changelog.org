    + In repository "straight.el", remote "origin" has URL
        "https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el"
             but recipe specifies a URL of
                "https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el.git"

         1) Abort
         2) Rename remote "origin" to "origin-1", re-create "origin" with correct URL, and fetch
         3) Rename remote "origin" manually, re-create it with correct URL, and fetch
         4) Delete remote "origin", re-create it with correct URL, and fetch (Choose this if unsure)
         5) Delete remote "origin", re-create it with manually set URL, and fetch

      How to proceed? (1, 2, 3, 4, 5; don't know? Pick 4) 4
      Really delete remote "origin"? (y or n) y
